        <h2>Part 1: What is a parrot?</h2>
        <p>Parrots are defined as belonging to the family of psittacines, or psittaciformes. Parrots have many features different from other birds. For example, most birds have an anisodactyl foot, which means 3 claws pointing forward and one in the back, ideal for perching on branches. Parrots, however, have zygodactyl feet, which means their claws are in an "X" formation, better for holding and manipulating objects, as befits their incredible intelligence. Parrots also have strong, down-curving beaks that are best suited for helping them climb, crack hard shells, and, again, manipulate objects.</p>
        <h2>Part 2: Best Parrots!</h2>
        <p>This section is obviously subjective, but in my opinion there are two general areas of parrots that are my favorite: amazons, and Australian parrots. Amazons are found in and around the Amazon rainforest, as you might expect, and are generally found in South America. Australian parrots are definitely from the continent of Australia, and include some of the most iconic parrots, such as:<ol>
            <li>Budgerigar</li>
            <li>Cockatiels</li>
            <li>Cockatoos</li>
            <li>Lorikeets</li>
            <li>Ringnecks</li>
        </ol> My favorite parrot apart from these is the kākāpō, which can be found n New Zealand and holds the Guiness World Record for being the 'World's Densest Bird'.</p>
