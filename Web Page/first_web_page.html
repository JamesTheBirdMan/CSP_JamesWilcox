        <h1 class="title">Differences Between Juvenile and Adult Parrots</h1>
        <h2 id="header1">Adult Parrots</h2>
        <div class="grid1">
            <div>
                Fully matured parrots have a clear separation between the iris and the sclera, as the eye is fully developed and is done growing.</div>
            <div>Obviously, adult parrots will have all their feathers grown in, and very little pinfeathers, unless they are molting. (Pinfeathers are growing feathers, encased in a waxy sheath until they are done growing.)</div>
            <div>Adult parrots' foreheads will usually be a solid color or a specific pattern, with little variance.</div>
            <div>For parakeets specifically, adult budgerigars will have distinct and vibrant 'throat spots', splashes of color on their cheeks.</div>
            <div>Finally, normal adult posture is for the parrots to stand up tall, leaning forward at a slight angle with their wings tucked in tight and their beaks closed.</li></div>

            <h2 id="header2">Baby and Juvenile Parrots</h2>
            <div class="grid2">
                <div>Baby and juvenile parrots have a solid black eyeball, with no distinct difference between any of the eye parts.</div>
                <div>Young parrots' foreheads, when they are fully covered by feathers, are almost always dappled with black and grey spots or lines.</div>
                <div>Baby parrots will be almost completely naked, with a few pinfeathers and maybe a full feather or two poking out here and there. Juvenile parrots, however, will be almost completely covered in pinfeathers, with little skin or fully grown feathers showing.</div>
                <div>Juvenile budgies' throat spots are either made of neutral colors, faint, or completely nonexistent.</div>
                <div>Until they are fully matured, young parrots will constantly be hunched over, low to the ground, wings drooping, with their beak slightly open.</li></div>
