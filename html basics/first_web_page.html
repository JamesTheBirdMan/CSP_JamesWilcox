        <h1>Differences Between Juvenile and Adult Parrots</h1>
        <h2>Adult Parrots</h2>
        <p>Fully matured parrots have a clear separation between the iris and the rest of the eye, as the eye is fully developed and is done growing. Obviously, adult parrots will have all their feathers grown in, and very little pinfeathers, unless they are molting. Pinfeathers are growing feathers, encased in a waxy sheath until they are done growing. Adult parrots' foreheads will usually be a solid color or a specific pattern, with little variance. For parakeets specifically, adult budgerigars will have distinct and vibrant 'throat spots', splashes of color on their cheeks. Finally, normal adult posture is for the parrots to stand up tall, leaning forward at a slight angle with their wings tucked in tight and their beaks closed.</p>
        <h2>Baby and Juvenile Parrots</h2>
        <p>Baby and juvenile parrots have a solid black eyeball, with no distinct difference between any of the eye parts. Baby parrots will be almost completely naked, with a few pinfeathers and maybe a full feather or two poking out here and there. Juvenile parrots, however, will be almost completely covered in pinfeathers, with little skin or fully grown feathers showing. Young parrots' foreheads, when they are fully covered by feathers, are almost always dappled with black and grey spots or lines. Juvenile budgies' throat spots are either made of neutral colors, faint, or completely nonexistent. Until they are fully matured, young parrots will constantly be hunched over, low to the ground, wings drooping, with their beak slightly open.</p>
