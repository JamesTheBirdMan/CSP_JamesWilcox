        <h1>Differences Between Juvenile and Adult Parrots</h1>
        <h2>Adult Parrots</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fully matured parrots have a clear separation between the iris and the rest of the eye, as the eye is fully developed and is done growing.</li>
            <li>Obviously, adult parrots will have all their feathers grown in, and very little pinfeathers, unless they are molting. (Pinfeathers are growing feathers, encased in a waxy sheath until they are done growing.)</li>
            <li>Adult parrots' foreheads will usually be a solid color or a specific pattern, with little variance.</li>
            <li>For parakeets specifically, adult budgerigars will have distinct and vibrant 'throat spots', splashes of color on their cheeks.</li>
            <li>Finally, normal adult posture is for the parrots to stand up tall, leaning forward at a slight angle with their wings tucked in tight and their beaks closed.</li></ul>

        <h2>Baby and Juvenile Parrots</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Baby and juvenile parrots have a solid black eyeball, with no distinct difference between any of the eye parts.</li>
            <li>Baby parrots will be almost completely naked, with a few pinfeathers and maybe a full feather or two poking out here and there. Juvenile parrots, however, will be almost completely covered in pinfeathers, with little skin or fully grown feathers showing.</li>
            <li>Young parrots' foreheads, when they are fully covered by feathers, are almost always dappled with black and grey spots or lines.</li>
            <li>Juvenile budgies' throat spots are either made of neutral colors, faint, or completely nonexistent.</li>
            <li>Until they are fully matured, young parrots will constantly be hunched over, low to the ground, wings drooping, with their beak slightly open.</li></ul>
